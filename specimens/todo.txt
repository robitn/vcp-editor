✅ Add toolbar buttons for creating new borders/images/buttons
✅ Implement Cut/Copy/Paste operations
✅ Add file browser dialog for image paths and button folders
✅ Save Window size and position
✅ Add keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+S for save, etc.)
✅ Test with the sample VCP file provided

✅ Implement element deletion
✅ Add Print... to File menu to print VCP image via OS native print dialog

✅ Warn of unsaved changes, allow saving
✅ Remember last file opened
✅ Settings... UI/UX
✅ Can Open dialog be clued where to open to based on context? Yes - uses last file dir, VCP resources folder, or home dir
✅ the save-folder location should honor the folder structure: (save-folder) -> skins, (save-folder) -> images, (save-folder) -> Buttons, (save-folder) -> Buttons -> [button-folders].
✅ Settings labels trigger a finger cursor but clicking does nothing
✅ Settings File "Default save location" should have a folder browser button
✅ Settings settings are typically auto-saved. Auto-save changes and remove "Save" button. Change "Cancel" button text to "Close"
✅ Add (empty, but developer editable) "attributions" box to About box.
✅Contextual menus:
    - Selected empty cell > Border, Button, Image
    - Select occupied cell > Border, -, Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete

✅ Font library for icons - restyle toolbar buttons 
✅ Versioning for the About
✅ It's become difficult to select the border for editing. __?__

✅ Debug:
✅ Border/Image/Button selection still has an issue. Border is now easy to select. But if a border interior cell is empty, user can only select border, and cannot add a new image/button. Must be allowed to add a button to an empty cell inside border interior. Possible solution is to only select border when clicking an edge. Also change cursor to help user find the border by hovering its edges.

Some redesign...
✅ VCP manual (pdf): (project root)/documents/samples/centroid_vcp_users_manual.pdf
✅     - Add color_on/color_off tags back to VCP Output pane (allows user to choose either led overlay or images).
✅     - We missed <on_click_swap>[file_name.svg]</on_click_swap> tag option and it's image selection. This covers what happens upon Button pressed event.
✅     - Button Editor > PLC Output > Output Number (<number></number>) is an LED number. Prefer a drop-down populated with LED numbers (ex: SpinOverPlusLED IS OUT1057 to text: "Spin Over Plus (1057)" value: 1057)
        - (see (project root)/documents/samples/acorn_mill_vcp_skin_x.vcp file.)
✅     - Button Editor > PLC Input > Input Number (<number></number>) is a user-configured controller input. 
✅     - Add <run> and <app> tags within <vcp_button>

Enhance: 
✅     - Inspector -> Border -> Fill Color should be a ColorPicker control - not a input control. But picker needs a "Transparent" option.
✅     - Toolbar > remove RefreshButton and place its functionality into a (new) View menubar item. Add Zoom In / Zoom Out menu items to View menu.
✅     - Add the functionality of Seetings > Grid tab to the View menu. (note: Settings is master and persistent, changes made via the View menu are volatile and do not last past App launches.)
✅     - Add "Save As" toolbar button (icon begins with saveas_) and wire into 'Save As' functionality.

Windows Bugs!
✅    - Menu key shortcuts are not working on Windows.
✅    - Newly opened window not resizing to the values stored in App support folder.
✅    - Button Editor: can't add optional buttons - path name contains a mix of back & forward slashes.

Layout (Windows & MacOS): 
✅    - Button Editor dialog doesn't fit smaller screens well, eg, less than 1920x1080. 
        - Reconstruct XML preview and Button Appearance|Behavior into a resizeable horizontal split panel, with responsive animated drag-bar. XML preview also wants to be scrollable.
✅    - Reduce Button preview size to 160px square.
✅    - Replace Toolbar setting button text character to svg image publicicons\"settings-gear.svg". Use the same html structure as other toolbar buttons. Anchor settings button to toolbar right edge.
Skip:    - Delete item wants a Delete symbol.
✅    - Settings dialog > File: 
        - change Vcp Resources span.help-text to "VCP folder containing new Buttons, Images, and skins folders"
        - change label text from "Default save location" to "Work in progress folder".
        - add <span.help-text to "Work in progress folder" - containing, "You will edit the files in this folder"
✅    - Theme change between light to dark isn't complete, must update title bar and toolbar

Change program logic / work flow: 
✅    - vcpResourcesFolder is source of new images/buttons artwork from an outside source, if applicable; use as a hint for Open file dialog. "Work in progress" is the folder to copy images opened from vcp resources folder.
✅    - If document isDirty flag was previously false and an edit makes isDirty true, then last Undo should set isDirty false, with window title indicating dirty or not state. If document isDirty flag was true, then last Undo should leave isDirty true.

🛑 Later:
Sort buttons by row then column.
Generate / add to user manual.

🔮 Future Features:
Multi tab window.

Add Open Recent > menuitem

Because images and buttons may be created by an outside developer. A floating or fixed palette of images and buttons from a (root) folder. Drag-n-Drop.
