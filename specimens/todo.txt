✅ Add actual drag-and-drop functionality for repositioning elements
✅ Implement Undo/Redo stack (5 levels as per spec)
✅ Add toolbar buttons for creating new borders/images/buttons
✅ Implement Cut/Copy/Paste operations
✅ Add file browser dialog for image paths and button folders
✅ Save Window size and position
✅ Add keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+S for save, etc.)
✅ Test with the sample VCP file provided
✅ Add visual feedback for multi-cell drag selection
✅ Implement element deletion
✅ Add Print... to File menu to print VCP image via OS native print dialog
✅ Add validation and error handling UI
✅ Change window title to document <filename>
✅ Change Application menu name to "VCP Editor"
✅ Warn of unsaved changes, allow saving
✅ Remember last file opened
✅ Settings... UI/UX
✅ Can Open dialog be clued where to open to based on context? Yes - uses last file dir, VCP resources folder, or home dir
✅ the save-folder location should honor the folder structure: (save-folder) -> skins, (save-folder) -> images, (save-folder) -> Buttons, (save-folder) -> Buttons -> [button-folders].
✅ Settings labels trigger a finger cursor but clicking does nothing
✅ Settings File "Default save location" should have a folder browser button
✅ Settings settings are typically auto-saved. Auto-save changes and remove "Save" button. Change "Cancel" button text to "Close"
✅ Add (empty, but developer editable) "attributions" box to About box.
✅Contextual menus:
    - Selected empty cell > Border, Button, Image
    - Select occupied cell > Border, -, Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete

✅ Font library for icons - restyle toolbar buttons 
✅ Versioning for the About
✅ It's become difficult to select the border for editing. __?__

✅ Debug:
✅ Border/Image/Button selection still has an issue. Border is now easy to select. But if a border interior cell is empty, user can only select border, and cannot add a new image/button. Must be allowed to add a button to an empty cell inside border interior. Possible solution is to only select border when clicking an edge. Also change cursor to help user find the border by hovering its edges.

Some redesign...
✅ VCP manual (pdf): (project root)/documents/samples/centroid_vcp_users_manual.pdf
✅     - Add color_on/color_off tags back to VCP Output pane (allows user to choose either led overlay or images).
✅     - We missed <on_click_swap>[file_name.svg]</on_click_swap> tag option and it's image selection. This covers what happens upon Button pressed event.
✅     - Button Editor > PLC Output > Output Number (<number></number>) is an LED number. Prefer a drop-down populated with LED numbers (ex: SpinOverPlusLED IS OUT1057 to text: "Spin Over Plus (1057)" value: 1057)
        - (see (project root)/documents/samples/acorn_mill_vcp_skin_x.vcp file.)
✅     - Button Editor > PLC Input > Input Number (<number></number>) is a user-configured controller input. 
✅     - Add <run> and <app> tags within <vcp_button>

Enhance: 
✅     - Inspector -> Border -> Fill Color should be a ColorPicker control - not a input control. But picker needs a "Transparent" option.
✅     - Toolbar > remove RefreshButton and place its functionality into a (new) View menubar item. Add Zoom In / Zoom Out menu items to View menu.
✅     - Add the functionality of Seetings > Grid tab to the View menu. (note: Settings is master and persistent, changes made via the View menu are volatile and do not last past App launches.)
✅     - Add "Save As" toolbar button (icon begins with saveas_) and wire into 'Save As' functionality.

Windows Bugs!
    - Menu key shortcuts are not working on Windows
    - Newly opened window not resizing to the values stored in App support folder.
    - Button Editor: can't add optional buttons - path name contains forward slashes.

Layout (Windows & MacOS): 
        - Button Editor dialog doesn't fit smaller screens, eg, less than 1920x1080. 
            - XML panel must be resizeable (height from bottom by way of a drag-bar) and that size stored in app support settings.json. Make XML preview scrollable.
        - Reduce Button preview size to 160px square.
        - Replace Toolbar setting button text character to svg image "settings-gear.svg. Use the same html structure as other toolbar buttons.


🛑 Later:
Sort buttons by row then column.
Generate / add to user manual.

🔮 Future Features:
Multi tab window.

Add Open Recent > menuitem

Because images and buttons may be created by an outside developer. A floating or fixed palette of images and buttons from a (root) folder. Drag-n-Drop.
